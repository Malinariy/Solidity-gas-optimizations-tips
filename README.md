## Gas optimizations tips found in open source audits ðŸ’¡

*REQUIRE()/REVERT()*Â STRINGS LONGER THAN 32 BYTES COST EXTRA GAS
```python
def utf8len(s):
    return len(s.encode('utf-8'))

utf8len('FCash to redeem must be an index component')
```

â¬œ * PRIVATE *Â FUNCTIONS NOT CALLED BY THE CONTRACT SHOULD BE REMOVED TO SAVE DEPLOYMENT GAS
---*
â¬œ ADDING * UNCHEKED * DIRECTIVE CAN SAVE GAS
> For arithmetic operations that will not owerflow/underflow anyone, use unchecked, this will help save gas from unnecessary > owerflow/underflow checks in solidity version starting with 0.8
---
â¬œ *array.length* SHOULD NOT BE LOOKED UP IN EVERY LOOP OF FOR-LOOP
> Reading array length at each iteration of the loop takes 6 gas
---
â¬œ *++i*Â COSTS LESS GAS COMPARED TOÂ *i++*Â ORÂ *i += 1*Â (SAME FORÂ *--i*Â VSÂ *i--*Â ORÂ *i -= 1*)
**Increment:**
- `i += 1`Â is the most expensive form
- `i++`Â costs 6 gas less thanÂ `i += 1`
- `++i`Â costs 5 gas less thanÂ `i++`Â (11 gas less thanÂ `i += 1`)
**Decrement:**
- `i -= 1`Â is the most expensive form
- `i--`Â costs 11 gas less thanÂ `i -= 1`
- `-i`Â costs 5 gas less thanÂ `i--`Â (16 gas less thanÂ `i -= 1`)

â¬œ USE 'address(0)' INSTEAD OF '0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'
---*
â¬œ CHECK IF *AMOUNT > 0* BEFORE TOKEN TRANSFER CAN SAVE GAS
> IT IS WORTH CHECKING THE *AMOUNT â‰  0*, BEFORE THE TRANSFER CAN CREATE AN EXTERNAL CALL AND SPEND UNNECESSARY GAS COST
---
â¬œ *> 0* CAN BE REPLACED WITH *!= 0* FOR GAS OPTIMIZATION
> *!= 0* IS A CHEAPER OPERATION COMPARED TO *> 0*, WHEN DEALING WITH UINT
---
â¬œ CONSIDER MAKING SOME CONSTANTS AS NON-PUBLIC TO SAVE GAS
> Switching from public to private/internal can save gas when the constant is not used outside od its contract
