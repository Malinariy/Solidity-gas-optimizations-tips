## Gas optimizations tips found in open source audits ðŸ’¡

â¬œ   `REQUIRE()/REVERT()`Â STRINGS LONGER THAN 32 BYTES COST EXTRA GAS
```python
def utf8len(s):
    return len(s.encode('utf-8'))

utf8len('FCash to redeem must be an index component')
```

---
â¬œ  `PRIVATE`Â FUNCTIONS NOT CALLED BY THE CONTRACT SHOULD BE REMOVED TO SAVE DEPLOYMENT GAS

---
â¬œ   ADDING `UNCHEKED` DIRECTIVE CAN SAVE GAS
> For arithmetic operations that will not owerflow/underflow anyone, use unchecked, this will help save gas from unnecessary > owerflow/underflow checks in solidity version starting with 0.8
---
â¬œ   `array.length` SHOULD NOT BE LOOKED UP IN EVERY LOOP OF FOR-LOOP
> Reading array length at each iteration of the loop takes 6 gas
---

â¬œ   `++i`Â COSTS LESS GAS COMPARED TOÂ *i++*Â ORÂ *i += 1*Â (SAME FORÂ `--i`Â VSÂ `i--`Â ORÂ `i -= 1`)
    Increment:
- `i += 1`Â is the most expensive form
- `i++`Â costs 6 gas less thanÂ `i += 1`
- `++i`Â costs 5 gas less thanÂ `i++`Â (11 gas less thanÂ `i += 1`)
    Decrement:
- `i -= 1`Â is the most expensive form
- `i--`Â costs 11 gas less thanÂ `i -= 1`
- `-i`Â costs 5 gas less thanÂ `i--`Â (16 gas less thanÂ `i -= 1`)

â¬œ   USE `address(0)` INSTEAD OF `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`

---
â¬œ   CHECK IF `AMOUNT > 0` BEFORE TOKEN TRANSFER CAN SAVE GAS
> It worth cheking the `AMOUNT â‰  0`, before the transfer can create an external call and spend unnecessary gas cost

---

â¬œ   `> 0` CAN BE REPLACED WITH `!= 0` FOR GAS OPTIMIZATION
> `!= 0` is a cheaper operation compared to `> 0`, when dealing with uint

---

â¬œ   CONSIDER MAKING SOME CONSTANTS AS NON-PUBLIC TO SAVE GAS
> Switching from public to private/internal can save gas when the constant is not used outside od its contract
---

â¬œ UNUSED NAMED RETURN VARIABLES - 3 gas per instance

---

â¬œ  CONSTRUCTOR PARAMETERS SHOULD BE AVOIDED WHEN POSSIBLE
> Constructor parameters are expensive. The contract deployment will be cheaper in gas if they are hard coded instead of using constructor parameters

---

â¬œ  CALLDATA INSTEAD OF MEMORY FOR READ-ONLY FUNCTION PARAMETERS
> If a reference type function parameter is read-only, it is cheaper in gas to use calldata instead of memory. (Calldata is a non-modifiable, non-persistent area where function arguments are stored, and behaves mostly like memory)
--- 
â¬œ  CACHING STORAGE VARIABLES IN MEMORY TO SAVE GAS
> Anytime you are reading from storage more than once, it is cheaper in gas cost to cache the variable in memory: a SLOAD cost 100gas, while MLOAD and MSTORE cost 3 gas.
--- 
â¬œ  `uint256` instead of `uint8`
> The EVM works with 256bit/32byte words. Every operation is based on these base units. If the data used is smaller, further operation are needed to downscale from 256 bits to 8 bits.
--- 
â¬œ  `X = X + Y` IS CHEAPER THAN `X += Y` (Same for `X = X - Y` is cheaper than `X -= Y`)
> `X += Y` costsÂ 3,more gas than `X = X + Y`.
---
â¬œ UNNECESSARY COMPUTATION
> Gas can be saved by avoiding using local variables when they are not necessary.
